What publishers are looking for these days isn't radical feminism.  It's
corporate feminism -- a brand of feminism designed to sell books and
magazines, three-piece suits, airline tickets, Scotch, cigarettes and,
most important, corporate America's message, which runs: Yes, women were
discriminated against in the past, but that unfortunate mistake has been
remedied; now every woman can attain wealth, prestige and power by dint
of individual rather than collective effort.
